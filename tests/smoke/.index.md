- `/Users/josh/Desktop/MetrIQ/projects/teambuild/imp/tests/smoke/__init__.py` — Smoke tests - validate modules work in real usage, not just test harnesses. (1 lines)
- `/Users/josh/Desktop/MetrIQ/projects/teambuild/imp/tests/smoke/smoke_test_interview.py` — Smoke test for interview layer - validates real usage patterns.

This script tests the interview module as a real user would use it:
- Imports modules like a developer would
- Creates InterviewSpec instances and validates them
- Tests JSON round-trips and file validation
- Uses real validator logic (deterministic, no AI)

Run: python tests/smoke/smoke_test_interview.py
Exit code: 0 = pass, 1 = fail

This is NOT a pytest test. This is a smoke test that validates the module
works in the wild, not just in a test harness. (390 lines)
- `/Users/josh/Desktop/MetrIQ/projects/teambuild/imp/tests/smoke/smoke_test_metrics.py` — Smoke test for metrics layer - validates real usage patterns.

This script tests the metrics layer as a real user would use it:
- Imports modules like a developer would
- Creates collectors and storage
- Records events and persists to JSONL
- Validates all public APIs work in production

Run: python tests/smoke/smoke_test_metrics.py
Exit code: 0 = pass, 1 = fail

works in the wild, not just in a test harness. (359 lines)
- `/Users/josh/Desktop/MetrIQ/projects/teambuild/imp/tests/smoke/smoke_test_pm.py` — Smoke tests for imp.pm module - validates real usage patterns.

This script tests the PM layer as a real user would use it:
- Imports modules like a developer would
- Creates models and uses mapper
- Validates PlaneAdapter initialization
- Tests serialization/deserialization
- Validates enums and error handling

Run: uv run python tests/smoke/smoke_test_pm.py
Exit code: 0 = pass, 1 = fail

works in the wild, not just in a test harness. (392 lines)
- `/Users/josh/Desktop/MetrIQ/projects/teambuild/imp/tests/smoke/smoke_test_provider.py` — Smoke test for provider layer - validates real usage patterns.

This script tests the provider layer as a real user would use it:
- Imports modules like a developer would
- Creates providers and invokes them
- Validates cost calculation, model roster, configuration
- Uses real Pydantic AI (with TestModel to avoid API calls)

Run: python tests/smoke/smoke_test_provider.py
Exit code: 0 = pass, 1 = fail

This is NOT a pytest test. This is a smoke test that validates the module
works in the wild, not just in a test harness. (455 lines)
- `/Users/josh/Desktop/MetrIQ/projects/teambuild/imp/tests/smoke/smoke_test_review.py` — Smoke test for review module.

This is a standalone script that validates the review module works

Exit codes:
- 0: All smoke tests passed
- 1: At least one smoke test failed (494 lines)
- `/Users/josh/Desktop/MetrIQ/projects/teambuild/imp/tests/smoke/smoke_test_validation.py` — Smoke test for validation module.
