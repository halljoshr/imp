- `/Users/josh/Desktop/MetrIQ/projects/teambuild/imp/src/imp/review/__init__.py` — Review layer — two-pass code review with AI-to-AI handoff.

Public API exports for the review module.

Pass 1: Automated checks via `imp check` (validation runner)
Pass 2: AI deep review with false positive prevention

From conversation 015: Simple ReviewHandoff model (3 fields). NO three-tier system.
Build complexity when we hit the problem, not before. (28 lines)
- `/Users/josh/Desktop/MetrIQ/projects/teambuild/imp/src/imp/review/cli.py` — CLI commands for code review. (182 lines)
- `/Users/josh/Desktop/MetrIQ/projects/teambuild/imp/src/imp/review/models.py` — Review data models.

Simple ReviewHandoff model with 3 fields:
- agent_prompt: AI-to-AI handoff instructions
- relevant_files: Files needing attention
- issues: Structured issue list

Following the Linus critique from conversation 015: build the simplest version
that proves the core idea. NO three-tier handoff system. Single JSON file per review.
Build handoff complexity when we hit the problem, not before. (196 lines)
- `/Users/josh/Desktop/MetrIQ/projects/teambuild/imp/src/imp/review/prompts.py` — AI review prompts with false positive prevention.

From research/code-review/ai-reviewer.mjs and conversation 015:
- Mandatory 5-point self-check before reporting any issue
- Banned speculative language ("may", "might", "could")
- Zero issues = ideal outcome (never invent issues to appear thorough) (109 lines)
- `/Users/josh/Desktop/MetrIQ/projects/teambuild/imp/src/imp/review/runner.py` — ReviewRunner — orchestrates two-pass code review.

Pass 1: Automated checks via ValidationRunner (imp check)
Pass 2: AI deep review with false positive prevention
